# User management platform

- Add a method to create a function that creates a user object with the following properties : first name, surname, age
- Create an array with a few users on page startup
- Add a method to return the user info as a string
- Add a method to display all users in a list in our page
- Add inputs and a button to add a user to our list
- Add a surname and age inputs and take them into account when adding a new user
- Fix the displayUsers function so it refresh the list content, not add content to it
- Modify the display_users function to use forEach
- Add a delete button next to each user listed, use slice to remove him from our array
- Filter adults and minors using the filter method, and show them in two different part of the page.

## To be fixed

- make the displayUsers work when adding a user, create a refresh function with all the displayusers call
- make the delete button work again using the filters

## 27/11 tasks
